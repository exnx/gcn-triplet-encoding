Created on Wed Feb 19 10:19:45 2020


from the normalized iou_dict, separate out ids, iou_norm for
    -    > 0.7 (0.7 is set as the threshold for selecting the positives.) 
    - 0.6-0.7 
    - 0.5-0.6 
    - 0.4-0.5

Also ids between ious 0.2-0.4

Note:
Many of the images will be filtered out from anchors (30-40%)
However, note that the other images in the train set can occur as negative sets...

Changed the pos threhold to >0.6.
